<h3>Venue: Reykjavik University</h3>

<p>The conference will take place on the campus
  of <a href="https://en.ru.is/">Reykjavik University (RU)</a>
  (consisting essentially of one building), by the Fossvogur bay and
  between the grounds of the domestic airport (RKV) and the Öskjuhlíð
  hill.</p>

<p>The address is Menntavegi 2, 102 Reykjavik. Here is a map.</p>

<p>Reykjavik University is not to be mixed up with
  the <a href="https://english.hi.is/">University of Iceland</a>, at
  the opposite end of the domestic airport grounds.</p>


<h3>Reaching Reykjavik University</h3>

<p>From the very center of Reykjavik, say, the Hallgrímskirkja church,
  the RU is a 35 mins walk.</p>

<p>From the Gamla Hringbraut stop (next to BSÍ) it is 2 stops to the
 HR (Nauthóll) stop with bus 8 and a whopping 670 ISK in the morning
 and during the day.</p>

<p>From elsewhere you can connect with buses 1, 3, 5, 6, 15.</p>

<p>In the evening you get to RU (and from it) not only from Gamla
 Hringbraut, but also a number of other central stops (Sjúkrahótel,
 Heilsuverndarstöðin, Skeggjagata, Laugavegur, Rúgbrauðsgerði,
 Höfðatorg, Þjóðskjálasafnið, Hátún) directly with bus 5. Bus 8
 does not run then.</p>


<h3>About the university</h3>

<p>Reykjavik University is young and small. Differently from the
  University of Iceland, it is a private university.</p>

<p>RU was established in 1998 based on the Computer Science School of
  the Commercial College of Iceland. RU has approx 3000 students.</p>

<p>RU does not teach all subjects, only engineering, computer science,
  law, business, psychology and sports science.</p>

<p>The Nauthólsvík campus was opened in 2010, in the middle of the
  financial crisis, significantly downsized compared to the original
  ambition. It was designed
  by <a href="https://www.henninglarsen.com/">Henning Larsen</a>
  (Copenhagen) and ARKIS Arkitektar (Iceland). Henning Larsen has
  designed a number of university buildings, but also for example
  Harpa in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>In 2020, Times Higher Education (THE) ranked RU the 1st for
  citations (with 6 other universities), the 301st-350th overall, the
  59th among the universities not older than 50 years and the 14th
  among the universities with fewer than 5000 students.</p>

<p>[I will not mention that, in 2025, RU was ranked the 801st-1000th
  overall by THE. Their 2025 young and small university rankings are
  not out yet, but in 2024 RU was the 201st-250th young university and
  the 41st small university.]</p>
