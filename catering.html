 an external caterer, Bakarameistarinn, complemented with our own
 coffee, just outside the conference rooms M208 and M209.</p>

  minisandwiches, flatkaka, brauðterta (= the Swedish smörgåstårta)
  and the like.</p>

<h3>Mon-Wed</h3>

<p>On Mon-Wed, both the coffee breaks and lunches will be provided by
the university's caterer, Málið.</p>

<p>Coffee and sides will be served in or near the room of each
conference track.</p>

<p>For the lunch, you will go to the university canteen to queue
  together with the students and staff. You can choose</p>
  <ul>
  <li>a main dish (there are two options each day, one of them vegan)
    or a soup or a salad you compose yourself at the salad bar,
  <li>and, if you like, a dessert (skyr, greek yogurt or a vitamin shot)  
  <li>and, if you like, water or a sugary drink  
  </ul>

<p>On the counter for the two options for main dish, there is a
placard with a declaration of lactose/gluten/allergens in the main
dish. The salad option with the variety that is there should work with
any diet.</p>

<p>At the checkout, show your conference badge. You will not have to
  pay unless you have picked more items than permitted by the
  specification above.</p>

<p>Málið's <a href="https://malid.ru.is/en">menu of the week</a> is
here (the menu for the week 29 Sept-3 Oct will be posted on 28
  Sept).</p>

<li>catch of the day with vegetable ragout, broccolini and chive sauce</li>
<li>white chocolate skyr mousse with blackberry sauce and mango sorbet</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Participants who declared a restricted diet or
intolerances/allergies/other food restrictions: the caterer has been
informed of your diet and you will get something meeting your
restrictions.</p>

<p>Please place your badge on the table near your plate, the little
dots on your badge will give the waiters the necessary information
about your diet.</p>

  the university canteen.</p>
