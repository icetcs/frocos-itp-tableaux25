<h3>Weather</h3>

<p>The place to check is <a href="https://en.vedur.is/">vedur.is</a>,
  the website of Iceland's Met Office. You will find the weather
  forecast and observations (including aurora) as well as earthquake
  observations etc.</p>
  
 
<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>Accommodation is generally expensive in Greater Reykjavik and
  Iceland in general and not necessarily of the best quality for what
  you pay. It is something that you simply have to put up
  with. Use <a href="https://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a>
  or <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a>, read reviews, and
  choose the location carefully.</p>

<p>Public buses are infrequent and expensive. So even if your hotel is
  not very far, if it is not walking distance from Reykjavik
  University, the conference venue, you may be in mild
  trouble. (Notice that you need Reykjavik University, not the
  University of Iceland; both are located next to the domestic
  airport, but at opposite ends).</p>

<p>In general, any location in Reykjavik districts 101, 102 is fine
  and 105 and 107 too. (Residents of Greater Reykjavik tend to
  identify city districts by postal codes.) Walking from the center of
  101 to Reykjavik University takes about 35 mins.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icelandhotelcollectionbyberjaya.com/en/hotels/reykjavik/reykjavik-natura">Hotel
  Natura</a> is between the city center and the university, also very close
  to the terminal of Reykjavik Excursions (Icelandia) at BSÍ.</p>

<h3>Money</h3>

<p>No-one uses cash in Iceland. We recommend that you do not exchange
currency or withdraw Icelandic cash from an ATM.</p>


<h3>Getting from the airport to Reykjavik</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kefairport.com/">Keflavík
  international airport (KEF)</a> is next to the town of Reykjanesbær
  some 50 kms from Reykjavik.</p>

<p>You get to the city with the Flybus service of the commercial
  operator
  <a href="https://www.re.is/">Reykjavik Excursions
  (Icelandia)</a>. The transfer costs about 4000 ISK one way. If you
  add a connection to your hotel/guesthouse, that is another 1000
  ISK. There is a ticket booth in the arrivals hall and buses depart
  close to the entrance. There is no need to book the ticket in
  advance on the way to Reykjavik. (On the way back to the airport you
  might want an advance booking, including a pickup from your
  accommodation.)</p>

<p>There is also the line 55 of the Icelandic public bus
  system <a href="https://www.straeto.is/en">Strætó</a>. The ride
  costs 2680 ISK one way. The bus stop is a bit hidden close to the
  airport hotel Aurora. This bus is infrequent, but you can check the
  schedules. You can buy the ticket from the driver on the vehicle and
  it is also good for changing in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>Unless you are Norwegian, you do not want to think of taking a taxi
  from/to the airport if you are not 3 people sharing.</p>


<h3>Getting around in Reykjavik</h3>

<p>The center is small. For places a bit further, you may need to use
  city buses of <a href="https://www.straeto.is/en">Strætó</a>. A
  single ticket costs 670 ISK (335 ISK for people aged 67 or older),
  it is valid for changes in the Greater Reykjavik area during 75
  mins. You can use the Klappið app or pay contactless on the bus
  (only the full fare 670 ISK). Drivers do not sell tickets.</p>

<p>From the center to the university you can get with bus 8 from Gamla
  Hringbraut to HR.  This is just 2 stops, but it is a walk of 20 mins
  along the perimeter of the domestic airport. To Gamla Hringbraut,
  you have to walk or take some other bus (1, 3, 5, 6, 15), depending
  on where you are staying.

<p>In evenings and on weekends, one gets to/from HR with bus 5
  instead. This route starts in a far-out suburb in the East of
  Reyjavik, stops at Ártún (a major stop for changing between lines),
  passes through Laugardalur, the city center (the Laugavegur stop)
  and Gamla Hringbraut.</p>


<h3>Eating out and foodstores</h3>

<p>Eating out is expensive, but nicer restaurants are nice, no
  doubt.</p>

<p>The useful foodstore chains are Bónus, Krónan and Nettó.  Opening
  times vary, some stores open later and close earlier than you would
  expect. At 10-11 and Krambúð stores (open long or round the clock)
  you will find a limited selection and high prices.</p>
  
<h3>Swimming pools</h3>

<p>The best and also the cheapest fun in Reykjavik are
the <a href="https://reykjavik.is/en/swimming-pools">municipal
geothermally heated swimming pools</a>. The main ones in the city are
Laugardalslaug, Sundhöll Reykjavíkur and Vesturbæjarlaug. You get an
outdoor swimming pool (25 m in most places, 50 m in Laugardalslaug;
the water temperature is 26 C all year round), hotpots (38-42 C) and
steam saunas. Sundhöll Reykjavíkur is the most central
one. Laugardalslaug is the biggest and most fun. A single ticket costs
1380 ISK.</p>

<p>All swimming pools are open from early morning until 22.00 and this
means you can stay in the pool until 22.00 and then have 15 extra
minutes to change and rush out.</p>
  
<p>Just behind Reykjavik University, there is
the <a href="https://nautholsvik.is/en/">Nauthólsvík geothermal
beach</a>. Here the fun consists in a hotpot and dips in the ocean
(seawater ~5 C), there is also a steam sauna. This place is open 11-19
daily, until 16 on Sat, closed Sun and Mon. A single ticket is 920 ISK
(free for people aged 67 years or older).</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://www.bluelagoon.com/">Blue
Lagoon</a> if you want to pay a lot more. It is closer to the airport
than to Greater Reykjavik and you will need a whole morning or
afternoon to go there. The <a href="https://www.skylagoon.com/">Sky
Lagoon</a> is a fancy spa in Kópavogur.</p>

<p>If you are into this type of thing, take your swimming gear with
  you!</p>


<h3>Tourism</h3>

<p>There is lots to see both in Reykjavik and out in the countryside.
  See <a href="https://visitreykjavik.is/">Visit Reykjavik</a>
  and <a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/">Visit Iceland</a>.

  Many operators (<a href="https://www.re.is/">Reykjavik
  Excursions</a>, <a href="https://grayline.is/">Gray
  Line</a>, <a href="https://bustravel.is/">Bus
  Travel</a>, <a href="https://adventures.is/">Arctic Adventures</a>
  and others) offer day tours to the countryside. The most famous such
  tours are the Golden Circle (Þingvellir national park, Geysir,
  Gullfoss waterfall) and the Southern Shore Adventure
  (Seljalandsfoss, Skógafoss waterfalls, Sólheimajökull glacier
  tongue, Reynisfjara black sand beach). Alternatively you can rent a
  car.
