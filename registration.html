<h3>Registration</h3>
  
<p>Registration will open soon. We are striving to make the fees low,
  but Iceland is an expensive country.</p>

<p>Here is what you can expect.</p>

<p>You will be able to choose between the following for in-person
  participation: TABLEAUX (3 days Sat-Mon), FroCoS (3 days Mon-Wed),
  TABLEAUX+FroCoS (5 days Sat-Wed), ITP (4 days Sun-Wed), Rocq+ITP (5
  days Sat-Wed), ITP+Lean (5 days Sun-Thu), Rocq only (1 day Sat),
  Lean only (1 day Thu).</p>

<p>By default all of these fees include coffee breaks and lunches
  during the days paid for. There will be early vs late rates, full
  vs reduced (student/retired) rates and the option of including the
  conference dinner Mon evening.</p>

<p>One author of every accepted paper must pay the full fee. It need
  not be the presenter: for example a student may present the paper
  and pay the reduced fee if a supervisor will also attend and pay the
  full fee.</p>

<p>Cancellation will be possible up until 2 weeks before the start of
  the conference conference (until 13 September), but we will withhold
  a 100 EUR administrative fee.</p>

<p>Online participation will most likely be completely free, but still
  require registration.</p>

<p>Notice, however, that every paper accepted by FroCoS, ITP or
  TABLEAUX must be presented in person, unless there are special
  circumstances in the picture and online presentation has been agreed
  with the organizers before the early registration deadline.</p>
