<h3>Registration</h3>
  
<p>Registration is open. We have aimed to make the fees low, but
  Iceland is an expensive country.</p>

<p>You can choose from among the following items for in-person
  participation: TABLEAUX (3 days Sat-Mon), FroCoS (3 days Mon-Wed),
  TABLEAUX+FroCoS (5 days Sat-Wed), ITP (4 days Sun-Wed), Rocq (1
  day Sat), Lean (1 day Thu).</p>

<p>All of these fees include coffee breaks and lunches during the days
  paid for. Full rates also include the conference dinner (Mon
  evening). There are early vs late rates, regular vs reduced
  (student/retired) rates and the saver option of not including the
  conference dinner.</p>

<p>Students and retired participants are entitled to reduced
  rates. Please provide a proof by email.</p>

<p><b>Early</b> registration is <b>until 25 August</b>. From 26
  August, late registration rates apply.</p>

<p>One author of every accepted paper of every constituent event must
  pay a regular (= non-reduced) in-person attendance fee. It need not
  be the presenter: for example a student may present the paper and
  pay a reduced fee if a supervisor will also attend and pay a regular
  fee. This applies to both the three conferences as well as the
  workshops.</p>

<p>Cancellation will be possible up until 2 weeks before the start of
  the conference (until 13 September), but we will withhold
  a 100 EUR administrative fee.</p>

<p>Online participation is free, but still requires registration. We
  are grateful for a small donation (appearing as any other fee on the
  ticket and receipt).</p>

<p>Every paper accepted by FroCoS, ITP or TABLEAUX must be presented
  in person, unless there are special circumstances in the picture and
  online presentation has been agreed with the organizers by the early
  registration deadline of 25 August.</p>

<p>Registration is with
  Fienta. <a href="https://fienta.com/frocos-itp-tableaux25/">Registration
  page at Fienta.</a>.

<p>You get can get a <b>receipt</b> from Fienta's system, but you need
  to pay attention, else you won't get one (will only
  get <b>tickets</b>). You can specify the payer data you need (eg
  your organization) in the <b>"Payment method" section</b> toward the
  end of the interaction session. For this, <b>check the box "I would
  like a receipt after payment"</b> and fill out the relevant details
  (organization, address, reg code, VAT number, other information you
  want on the invoice).
